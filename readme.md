## How to play

For now, user play as black vs stockfish. You can use arrows or hjkl to move the
cursor (green square). Place it over the piece that you want to move, press
enter or tab to select, move to the cell that you want to move and press enter
or tab again.

I think that the play never ends. Just SIGINT it.
